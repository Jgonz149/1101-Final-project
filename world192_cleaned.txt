overview armenia under the old centrally planned soviet system had built up textile machinebuilding and other industries and had become a key supplier to sister republics in turn armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials and energy from the other republics most of these supplies enter the republic by rail through azerbaijan and georgia the economy has been severely hurt by ethnic strife with azerbaijan over control of the nagornokarabakh autonomous oblast a mostly armenianpopulated enclave within the national boundaries of azerbaijan in addition to outright warfare the strife has included interdiction of armenian imports on the azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured armenians in nagornokarabakh an earthquake in december destroyed about onetenth of industrial capacity and housing the repair of which has not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central ussr administrative apparatus among facilities made unserviceable by the earthquake are the yerevan nuclear power plant which had supplied of armenias needs for electric power and a plant that produced onequarter of the output of elevators in the former ussr armenia has some deposits of nonferrous metal ores bauxite copper zinc and molybdenum that are largely unexploited for the midterm

caused production to plummet unemployment and inflation to soar and human misery to multiply the survival of the republic as a political and economic unit is in doubt both serbia and croatia have imposed various economic blockades and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups these areas contain most of the industry if a much smaller core muslim state survives it

the flag in the upper hoistside corner china economy overview beginning in late the chinese leadership has been trying to move the economy from the sluggish sovietstyle centrally planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market elements but still within the framework of monolithic communist control to this end the authorities have switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services and light manufacturing and opened the foreign economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures the most gratifying result has been a strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in the early s industry also has posted major gains especially in coastal areas near hong kong and opposite taiwan where foreign investment and modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and export goods aggregate output has more than doubled since on the darker side the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening central controls at intervals and thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process in output rose substantially particularly in the favored coastal areas popular resistance changes in central policy and loss of authority by rural cadres have

by political factionalism marked by armed struggles between the elected government and the opposition and industrial output seems to have fallen more steeply in georgia in than in any other of the

and stuttgart flag three equal horizontal bands of black top red and yellow germany economy overview the federal republic of germany is making substantial progress in integrating and modernizing eastern germany but at a heavy economic cost western germanys growth in slowed to the lowest rate since because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required by the unification process while western germanys economy was in recession in the last half of eastern germanys economy bottomed out after a nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery particularly in the construction transportation and service sectors eastern germany could begin a fragile recovery later concentrated in in construction transportation and services the two regions remain vastly different however despite eastern germanys progress western germany has an advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports it has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards abundant leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits western germany is relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral western germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced goods the regions economy is mature services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports in recent years manufacturing has accounted for about of gdp with other sectors contributing lesser amounts gross fixed investment in accounted for about of gdp in gdp in the western region was an estimated per capita in contrast eastern germanys economy is shedding the obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the communist era eastern germanys share of allgerman gdp is only about and eastern productivity is just that of the west the privatization agency for eastern germany the treuhand is rapidly selling many of the firms under its control the pace of private investment is starting to pick up but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain eastern germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite coal but little else in the way of mineral resources the quality of statistics from eastern germany is improving yet many gaps remain the federal government began producing allgerman data for select economic statistics at the start of the most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern germanys economic reconstruction specifically finding the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will spur investment in eastern germany without destabilizing western germanys economy or damaging relations with west european partners the biggest danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could fuel inflation and prompt the german central bank the bundesbank to keep a tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral meanwhile

per year imports mainly oil capital goods consumer durables and food have been outstripping exports with the difference covered by aid remittances and borrowing in mid the jordanian government began debtrescheduling negotiations and agreed to implement an imf program designed to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms the persian gulf crisis that began in august however aggravated jordans already serious economic problems forcing the government to shelve the imf program stop most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations aid from gulf arab

adversely affected economic development in per capita gdp was the highest in africa at but gdp growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in the world oil market import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although the reopening of the libyantunisian border in april and the libyanegyptian border in december have somewhat eased shortages austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the governments ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account surplus for the first time in five years the nonoil manufacturing

economy although substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old ussr lithuania historically lagged behind latvia and estonia in economic development it is ahead of its baltic neighbors however in implementing market reform the country has no important natural resources aside from its arable land and strategic location industry depends entirely on imported materials that have come from the republics of the former ussr lithuania benefits from its icefree port at klaipeda on the baltic sea and its rail and highway hub at vilnius which provides land communication between eastern europe and russia latvia estonia and belarus industry produces a small assortment of highquality products ranging from complex machine tools to sophisticated consumer electronics thanks to nuclear power lithuania is presently selfsufficient in electricity exporting its surplus to latvia and belarus the nuclear facilities inherited from the ussr however have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety standards agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former soviet union lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat second place for eggs and potatoes and fourth place for milk and dairy products grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries as to economic reforms lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at least of stateowned property industry agriculture and housing having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system other government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from eastern markets to the more competitive western markets for the moment lithuania will remain

russia inherited of the former ussrs defense production facilities and is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these plants to civilian production russia produces almost half of the old ussrs farm products but most warmclimate crops must be imported under the old ussr production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated in a single firm or a single

republic boundaries and the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows the situation in serbia and montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military strife this new state faces major economic problems first like the other former yugoslav republics serbia and montenegro depended on their sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and manufactures wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence as did the communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants the breakup of many of the trade links the sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics one singular factor in the economic situation of serbia and montenegro is the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily interested in political and military mastery not economic reform a further complication is the major economic sanctions by the leading industrial nations gdp exchange rate conversion billion

slovenia economy overview slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old yugoslav republics with a per capita income more than twice the yugoslav average indeed not far below the levels in neighboring austria and italy because of its strong ties to western europe and the small scale of damage during internecine fighting in yugoslavia slovenia has the brightest prospects among the former yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few years the political and economic disintegration of yugoslavia however has led to severe shortterm dislocations in production employment and trade ties for example overall industrial production fell in particularly hard hit were the iron and steel machinebuilding chemical and textile industries meanwhile fighting has continued in other republics leading to further destruction of longestablished trade channels and to an influx of tens of thousands of croatian refugees as in other former communist areas in eastern europe economic reform has often sputtered not only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by rankandfile people in the transition to a more marketoriented system the key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not yet begun bright spots for encouraging western investors are

foreigners from domestic production gnpgdp methodology in the economy section gnpgdp dollar estimates for the oecd countries the former soviet republics and the east european countries are derived from purchasing power parity ppp calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates the ppp method normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy in addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing for the quality of goods and services the division of a ppp gnpgdp estimate in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the ppp conversion rate one thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the us as one thousand dollars converted to the local currency at the ppp conversion rate will buy in the other country gnpgdp estimates for the ldcs on the other hand are based on the conversion of gnpgdp estimates in local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates one caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of gnpgdp in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when gnpgdp accounts are expressed in ppp terms as for example when an observer estimates the dollar level of russian or japanese military expenditures similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate procedures finally as academic research moves forward on the ppp method we hope to convert all gnpgdp estimates to this method in future editions of the world factbook growth rate population the annual percent change in the

captive register a register of ships maintained by a territory possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent of an internal register ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned abroad the captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register except that it is not the register of an independent state flag of convenience register a national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state the major flags of convenience foc attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements true foc registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag state thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances an foc register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad it is also referred to as an open register flag state the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register internal register a register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register these differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state when it functions as an foc register the norwegian international ship register and danish international ship register are the most notable examples of an internal register both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the norwegian and danish flags merchant ship a vessel that carries goods against payment of freight commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only register the record of a ships ownership and
